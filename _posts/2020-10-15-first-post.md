# First blog post!

## So here goes.

This is actually quite scary, I have never had a blog before, and I have never put myself out there like this before. So far I have enjoyed being "invisible"... 
I deleted my Facebook account some years ago, mostly because I never used it, and I felt like I was seeing way too many ads the few times I did open it. So one day 
I opened up the Facebook settings and just hit `delete account` button. I have not looked back since. 
Of course it meant that I lost contact with some people in other countries..... but to be honest I never did talk to anyone on Facebook, so I guess it really doesn't
matter.

Why am I starting a blog? 
I am honestly not sure yet. I have been learning Complete Machine Learning and Data Science Zero to Mastery at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com). It is actually 
recommended to have a blog to reflect on what I have leared. I am that far into the course now, that it is almost finished. When I finish this course, it will be the
second course I finish on Udemy. First course was Zero to Mastery Python, by Andrei Neagoie. I liked that course, and to be honest, I found Andrei to be good 
instructor. Udemy even gave me a certificate for finihing the course.

I honestly don't know how much this certificate is worth, or even if companies value it at all. The only thing I can say is that I am very happy that I finished the 
course. 

I haven't really used the Python knowledge very much so far. I made a discord bot I named Gary (Gary from Final Space), which had build in Google search and Google 
translation. I managed to have the translation part being able to translate into any supported language, given a pretext, and then it automatically figured out which
language you used. In other words, you could give Ukrainian prefix and then write the message in Spanish, or Greek. The translation however was not any better than 
Google translate.... so simple easy words/sentences would get the best translation. 

Unfortunately I have not been able to get Gary online for a while, at least not after some of Discord's updates. I haven't been able to figure out what exactly is 
stopping my bot to enter, but at the moment it is low on priorities. The source colde for my bot can be found at my Github page, so you can try it out if you want. 

### Why am I doing a blog post? 
I got a bit carried away there. I know this will not be a great post,,, after all, this is my first post. Why am I here......... 
I am learning Machine Learning, and I want to implement it. At the same time, I am getting a bit tired of coding and doing code related stuff. I guess it might be
because I am unemployed, and have been for over 10 months now. I have never been without a job for such a long time before. I have a decent diploma (B.Sc. in Energy 
and Environmental Engineering Technical), which really hasn't helped much. BUT **I make my own opportunities**, not some diploma or a title. So why I am doing a 
blog post??? 

I look at it as an outlet and who knows, I could post my findings of some ML (Machine Learning) stuff I do. First I want to actually finish this Zero to Mastery ML 
course, and I'll let you know when I have that certificate.
