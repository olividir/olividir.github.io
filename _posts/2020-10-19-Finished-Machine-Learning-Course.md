Good morning everyone!!

I was just finishing the Zero-to-Mastery-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science by Andrei and Daniel. I feel very happy that I finished this course. It was really challenging
for a while, and I was very close to lose interest in it. But I managed it. I noticed that my last post didn't display my image, not sure why, but I went exactly after
the tutorial on how to put in pictures. Anyway, here is the certificate (if it displays) for the Machine Learning. I feel very happy about it :D

Now I am going to need to do some projects to increase my skills. I am going to start with something simple, like one of these:
```
MNIST digit classification
Small image search engine
Object dection pipeline
```

All of these should be a good "starting point" for any upcoming ML engineer. I am currently most interesting in the "Small image search engine". I wonder how to start,
just like every other newbie. I think it is normal to not to know what to do with new found knowledge or how to apply it. I am therefore going to make my best in figure
it out with you, as I go along. After all, it would be super cool if you could use your mobile phone camera to check volume or mass of an object it sees. 

When I start doing my first project, I have to watch out not to look for a tutorial, I will need to figure otu the problems my self. Tutorials are cool and all that, but
I think it is better to figure out(or apply) a solution to your own project. I am therefore going to give myself maybe 6 weeks to get a working model.... and remember,
a bad working model, is still a working model. It is OK to do things badly to begin with, after all, at the beginning, we are looking to gain experience and hone our skills.


I'll think I'll have this blog short and start working on my project. I'll do my best to post about my findings in the future.

Regards.
