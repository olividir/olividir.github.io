# Very late update on my project

## Why such long time from last post?
Many reasons. I actually started having fun with Python and Kivy, and thought it would be super fun to make a "improved" smart bulb controller. Then my daughter decided
to come into this world (yes, I have been a dad to a girl for a week now), which is really happy times for me, but gives very limited time to work on this project. 
Finally, I decided to try out Arco Linux, basically because I was very interested in using it. While installing the new OS, I figured out that I forgot to back up my 
documentation of the process I had to go through in order to get the data ready. Then as I was working with the data, I realized that I basically have the same data 
on display, and not really relavant. 

I will upload the jupyter file to my github repo and add the link here. 

Other than that, I guess I need to find myself another project to play around with.
